                    <p>The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962.
                       The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica),
                       Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (guitar, backing vocals), 
                       Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano).
                       Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as
                       a touring member until his death in 1985. Brian Jones was the original
                       leader of the group. The band's primary songwriters, Jagger and Richards,
                       assumed leadership after Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager. 
                       Their musical focus shifted from covering blues songs to writing original 
                       material, a decision with which Jones did not agree. Jones left the band 
                       less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced 
                       by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, 
                       Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and continues on guitar in tandem with 
                       Richards. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their 
                       touring bassist. The Stones' touring keyboardists have included Nicky Hopkins
                       (1967–1982), Ian McLagan (1978–1981), Billy Preston (through the mid-1970s) 
                       and Chuck Leavell (1982–present).
                       <br><br>
                    
                       The Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the British Invasion of bands that
                       became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful 
                       and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. Rooted in blues and early rock and roll,
                       the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; 
                       songs such as "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" and "Paint It Black" became international
                       hits. After a short period of experimentation with psychedelic rock in the mid-1960s, 
                       the group returned to its "bluesy" roots with Beggars Banquet (1968), which along with 
                       its follow-ups Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main St. (1972),
                       is generally considered to be the band's best work and is seen as their "Golden Age." 
                       It was during this period they were first introduced on stage as 
                       "The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World.
                       <br>
                       <p>
                       The band continued to release commercially successful albums through the 1970s and early 1980s,
                       including Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981), the two best-sellers in their discography.
                       From 1983 to 1987 tensions between Jagger and Richards almost caused the band to split; however,
                       they overcame their differences and rekindled their friendship after a temporary separation to work 
                       on solo projects. The Stones experienced a comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), promoted by a large 
                       stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, the group has lost much of their mainstream relevancy and 
                       new material has been less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones continue to be a huge attraction
                       on the live circuit. By 2007, the band had four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time:
                       Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994–1995), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997–1998), Licks Tour (2002–2003) and 
                       A Bigger Bang (2005–2007).[3] Musicologist Robert Palmer attributes the endurance of the 
                       Rolling Stones to their being "rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music", 
                       while "more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone"
