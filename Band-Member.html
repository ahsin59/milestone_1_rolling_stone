   <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Early Lfe</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
         Michael Philip Jagger was born into a middle-class family in Dartford, Kent. His father, Basil Fanshawe "Joe" Jagger (13 April 1913 – 11 November 2006),
        and grandfather, David Ernest Jagger, were both teachers.[6] His mother, Eva Ensley Mary (née Scutts; 6 April 1913 – 18 May 2000), born in Sydney, Australia, 
        of English descent,was a hairdresser and an active member of the Conservative Party. Jagger's younger brother, Chris (born 19 December 1947), is also a musician.
        The two have performed together.
        Although brought up to follow his father's career path, Jagger "was always a singer" as he stated in According to the Rolling Stones. "I always sang as a child. 
        I was one of those kids who just liked to sing. Some kids sing in choirs; others like to show off in front of the mirror. I was in the church choir and I also loved 
        listening to singers on the radio–the BBC or Radio Luxembourg–or watching them on TV and in the movies.
    </p>
        <h5 class="card-title">Personal Life</h5>
        <p>
            Jagger has been married (and divorced) once and has also had several other relationships.
        From 1966 to 1969, Jagger had a relationship with Marianne Faithfull, the English singer-songwriter/actress with whom he wrote
       "Sister Morphine,"a song on the Rolling Stones' 1971 album Sticky Fingers. After his relationship with Faithfull ended,
       he pursued a relationship with Marsha Hunt from 1969 to 1970. Jagger met the American singer and, though Hunt was married, the pair
       began a relationship in 1969.The relationship ended in June 1970, when Hunt was pregnant with Jagger's first child, Karis. 
       She is the inspiration for the song "Brown Sugar," also from Sticky Fingers 
        
        </p>
        <h5 class="card-title">Professional Life</h5>
        <p>
             Jagger, Richards and Taylor soon joined up with Jones, who wanted to start
        his own group. Pianist Ian Stewart was also an early member of what would become 
        the Rolling Stones. By 1963, Charlie Watts had joined the band as its drummer and 
        Taylor departed, replaced by Bill Wyman. Stewart, however, stayed on to serve as 
        road manager, as well as playing and recording with the band. Under the direction of 
        their manager Andrew Loog Oldham, the Rolling Stones were marketed as a group of wild 
        and rough rockers. The group's wild style helped them land a deal with Decca Records. 
        Jagger was a key ingredient in the band's growing success, attracting audiences with his
        stage antics and sex appeal.

   <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Early Lfe</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
        Charles Robert "Charlie" Watts was born to Charles Richard Watts, 
           a lorry driver for the London Midland & Scottish Railway, and his 
           wife Lillian Charlotte (née Eaves)at University College Hospital,
           London, and raised (along with his sister Linda) in Kingsbury. 
           He attended Tylers Croft Secondary Modern School from 1952 to 1956;
           as a schoolboy, he displayed a talent for art, cricket and football.

          As a child, Watts lived in Wembley, at 23 Pilgrims Way. Many of Wembley's
          houses had been destroyed by German bombs during World War II; Watts and his
          family lived in a prefabricated home, as did many in the community.
          
    </p>
        <h5 class="card-title">Personal Life</h5>
        <p>
           He's been married to wife Shirley Ann Shephard for 54 years. 
           The Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts has revealed the secret 
           to his 54 year marriage. Watts met wife Shirley Ann Shephard before 
           the band hit the big time, and they married in 1964. 
           They have one daghter, Seraphina, born in 1968
        </p>
        <h5 class="card-title">Professional Life</h5>
        <p>
            Besides his music, Watts contributed graphic art to early Rolling Stones 
        records such as the Between the Buttons record sleeve and was responsible 
        for the 1975 tour announcement press conference in New York City. 
        The band surprised the throng of waiting reporters by driving and playing 
        "Brown Sugar" on the back of a flatbed truck in the middle of Manhattan traffic, 
        a gimmick AC/DC copied later the same year. (Status Quo repeated the trick for 
        the 1984 video to "The Wanderer" and U2 would later emulate it in the 2004 video for 
        "All Because of You".) Watts remembered this was a common way for New Orleans jazz 
        bands to promote upcoming dates. Moreover, with Jagger, he designed the elaborate 
        stages for tours, first contributing to the lotus-shaped design of that 1975 Tour 
        of the Americas, as well as the 1989–1990 Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour, the 1997 
        Bridges to Babylon Tour, the 2002–2003 Licks Tour, and the 2005–2007 A Bigger Bang Tour.

    <h5 class="card-title">Early Lfe</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
         (born 1 June 1947) is an English rock musician, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, artist, author and
       radio personality best known as a member of The Rolling Stones since 1975, as well as a member of Faces 
       and the Jeff Beck Group.Wood began his career in 1964, when he joined The Birds on guitar.
       He then joined the mod group The Creation, but remained with the group only for a short time and appeared
       on a small number of singles. Wood joined the Jeff Beck Group in 1967 as a bass player. 
       The band released two albums, Truth and Beck-Ola, which became moderate successes.
    </p>
        <h5 class="card-title">Personal Life</h5>
        <p>
           Wood was married twice, first to Krissy Findlay, and then to Jo Karslake. 
           He has three biological children: son Jesse with Findlay; and daughter 
           Leah and son Tyrone with Karslake. Wood also raised Jamie, Karslake's 
           son from a previous relationship. During his marriage to Findlay, Wood 
           had an affair with Pattie Boyd, who was married to Beatle George Harrison at the time.
       </p>
        <h5 class="card-title">Professional Life</h5>
        <p>
           Wood began his career as a professional musician in 1964 as a guitarist with the Birds, 
        a R&B band based in Yiewsley, Middlesex. A popular live act with a considerable fan base, 
        the Birds released several singles in the mid-1960s;Wood wrote or co-wrote nearly half 
        the songs the group recorded.
        By 1967 the Birds had disbanded, and Wood briefly took part in a project called Santa Barbera
        Machine Head before joining the Jeff Beck Group as a bassist. Along with vocalist Rod Stewart,
        Wood did several tours with Beck and recorded two albums: Truth in 1968 and Beck-Ola in 1969. 
        In between Jeff Beck Group projects, Wood also worked with the Creation.
        During the summer of 1969, Stewart and Wood also set the template for what would become 
        The Faces on An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down, Stewart's first solo album (known as 
        The Rod Stewart Album in the US). The backing band on the album also included Ian McLagan,
        Keith Emerson, Micky Waller and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer and later Armageddon and 
        7th Order), and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer).

              Musician, singer and songwriter Keith Richards was born on December 18, 1943, 
        in Dartford, England. Richards is one of the driving forces behind the Rolling Stones,
        the self-proclaimed "World's Greatest Rock & Roll Band." One early influence on the future 
        rhythm guitarist was his grandfather, a musician and bandleader. Richards's mother, Doris,
        also had a great ear for music. Richards developed a passion for singing as a child, performing 
        in choirs at school. Around the age of 10, he sang at the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 as part
        of a choir.

       Richards' voice changed in his teens, and so did his interests. Around the age of 15,
       he got his first guitar as a present from his mother. Richards devoted much of his time 
       to learning to play his instrument, teaching himself such songs as Elvis Presley's 
       "That's All Right, Mama." A poor student, Richards was expelled from Dartford Technical School for skipping class. </p>
